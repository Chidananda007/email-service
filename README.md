# Introduction
Email Service is a Spring Boot application designed to send emails using Java Mail Sender and Thymeleaf templates. It provides a simple REST API to send emails with dynamic content.
The email service is implemented with two providersâ€”SMTP and Mailgun.
The SMTP provider uses Java Mail Sender to send emails, while the Mailgun provider uses the Mailgun API to send emails.
you need to get your own smtp or mail gun account and update the application properties accordingly.

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
